            <h1>Project Summary:</h1>
                <p1>The analysis that will be described below was done for a 2013 final project during my undergraduate course for Advanced GIS. 
                
                This project started out with the idea that Salt water crocodiles spend more time in one type of cover type than another. 
                The goal for this project was to discover what cover type they spend more time. </p1>
        
        <div id = methods>
            <h1>Methods: Raster Analysis </h1>
                <p1>1. Stack bands 3 and 7 from Landsat data  
                    <br> </br>
                    2. Use Radiance Model in Erdas Imagine to correct for radiace. Stack 3 rasters
                    <br> </br>
                    3. Run Tassled Cap Analysis (separates brightness and greenness values to make it simpler to separate Wetlands from Savannah).
                    <br> </br>
                    4. Mosaic images together, for further analysis. 
                </p1>
                
            <h2>Methods: Homerange Analysis </h2>
                <p2>1. Create Kernel Rasters for each crocodile.
                <br></br>2. Create Isopleths for the 95%, 90%, 85% and 80% home range size. To see if there was a difference in home range 
                       sizes and also in the use and availability values. </p2>


            <h3>Methods: Use Vs. Availability Analysis </h3>
                </p3>1. Reclassify moasicked raster into 4 classifications, Wetlands, Savanah, Forest, Water.
                    <br> </br>
                    2. Convert Isopleths to polygons.
                    <br> </br>
                    3. Clip raster to polygons
                    <br> </br>
                    4. Use Tabulate Area (ArcMap)to calculate availability of the land cover 
                    <br> </br>
                    5. These values were all divided by 900 to acquire the pixel value per home
                    range.  These values were then imported to excel and formed into Bard Graphs.
                </p3>
